## Publication

> Colli, M.L., **Ramos-Rodríguez, M.**, Nakayasu, E.S. et al. An integrated multi-omics approach identifies the landscape of interferon-α-mediated responses of human pancreatic beta cells. *Nat Commun* **11**, 2584 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16327-0

knitr::include_graphics("figure/graphical_abstracts/ifn.png", error=FALSE)
```

## Data availability

The different datasets that were used in the publication can be downloaded from GEO with the following accessions: 


```{r echo=FALSE}
ids <- read.delim("../data/geo_ids_ifna.tsv")
knitr::kable(ids,
             col.names=c("GEO ID", "Experiment", "Link"))
```

## Data processing

### ATAC-seq

ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq experiments were processed using the custom [`pipelineNGS`](https://github.com/mireia-bioinfo/pipelineNGS) R package. The specific scripts used for processing such data can be found at the corresponding folders inside `data/IFN/`, in the source code repository for this website.
