This website contains all the necessary code to reproduce the analysis generated by me in the publications that form my PhD thesis. The two main publications try to explore the role of $\beta$ cells in different stages of the disease:

- IFN-$\alpha$ to model **early** *insulitis* in pancreatic $\beta$ cells
- IFN-$\gamma$ + IL-1$\beta$ to model **late** *insulitis* in pancreatic $\beta$ cells
